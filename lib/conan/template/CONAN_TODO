Conan the Deployer has set up your project.

Optional: if you are use AWS you can provision instances from a json file

* Add or edit ~/.fog to include your AWS access and secret key: It should look something like:
:default:
  :aws_access_key_id: AithisismykeyYxDr 
  :aws_secret_access_key: PeT/thisismysecretaccesskey9HyE

* Edit config/aws.json to describe your AWS environments

Now you can use capistrano to provision your environment

* cap staging aws:provision

Then you can write out the config/servers.json which will be used in the next steps

* cap staging aws:write_config
(this will actually write out all environments so you may need to re-run it if you provision a new environment)

Next, set up your deployment or if you are not using AWS start her:

* Edit config/servers.json to specify your stages, servers, and roles

* Edit the TODOs in deploy/chef/dna/*.json

* Add stage-/role-/server-specific files in deploy/chef/dna/*.json

* Add some post-deployment tests in test/deploy/smoke_test.rb that test the
  deployed app.

* Add your own recipes to deploy/chef/recipes/site-cookbooks

Finally, use Capistrano to configure your servers and deploy your application
to the desired stage:

* cap staging configure deploy

This list has been left in CONAN_TODO for you to peruse at your leisure.
